## Interesting Examples

### Wanderers in Existence

Overnight the music of the spheres fills us with light
Escaping all the worlds combined we slide into infinite starscape

Overnight the wanting of forever fills us with light
Escaping infinite starscape we slide into the base plateau

Within the year the dream of a dynasty helps us see
Leaving place of complexity we step into tree of knowledge

Within the year the light of us helps us see
And none have come to visit tree of knowledge

### Escape

Escaping all the worlds combined we slide into infinity of eden
And we rest deep in final frontier

### Wanderers in fabric of time

Flying out of fabric of time we glide together into throbbing light
And we are reborn in throbbing light

### Wanderers in Universe

Falling asleep in fabric of time we come to awaken inside endless horizon
And we are reborn in infinity of eden

### Wanderers in Existence

the music of the spheres helps us see
Flying out of fabric of time we glide together into endless horizon
Flying out of infinity of eden we glide together into place for anchor
Escaping place for anchor we slide into castle of trees
the light of us fills us with light
And we are reborn in source of understanding

### Wanderers into the fabric of Universe

the music of the spheres fills us with light
Leaving all the worlds combined we step into infinite starscape
the music of the spheres finds us wanting
Leaving infinite starscape we step into the base plateau
the music of the spheres fills us with light
Flying out of the streets at night we glide together into source of understanding
a brightly lit orb fills us with light
And we are reborn in castle of trees
