Limerick is a Poem Generator driven by a standard OOP description language.
The language is inspired by text adventure games. A virtual being is sent
down the world of your own imagination making observations and interacting
with objects you define within.

The following is a snippet out of a poem about a little universe filled
with light and love, and land; and forrest. Resulting Poems follow bellow.

```JavaScript

    universe.has(love);
    universe.contains(light);
    universe.contains(sea);
    sea.contains(land);
    sea.has(love);
    land.contains(forest);
    land.has(love);
    forest.has(light);
    forest.has(love);
    wanderer.enterInto(universe);

```

Version two introduces a stand-alone motion expression object with named variables:

```JavaScript

const language = {

  poemTitles: [
    /* note the elongated structure of title [actor(s) [motion] ... of [location]] */
    '{{actor_name}} falling into the fabric of {{location_name}}',
    '{{actor_name}} falling into the depths of {{location_name}}',
    '{{actor_name}} hidden within the h eights of {{location_name}}',
  ],

  closingLines: [
    'And we rest quietly in {{location_name}}',
    'And we are reborn within {{location_name}}',
    'And we find adventure in {{location_name}}',
    'And none will come to visit {{location_name}} again.',
  ],

  itemInteractions: [
    'Thinking of {{item_name}} helps us understand',
    'Understanding {{item_name}} finds us wanting',
    'Within the year {{item_name}} helps us see',
    'Overnight {{item_name}} fills us with light',
  ],

  locationTransitions: [
    'Leaving {{location_name}} we step into {{destination_name}}',
    'We fly out of {{location_name}} together',
    'We glide together into {{destination_name}}',
    'Escaping {{location_name}} we slide into {{destination_name}}',

```
