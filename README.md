## Interesting Examples

### Wanderers in Existence

    Overnight the music of the spheres fills us with light
    Escaping all the worlds combined we slide into infinite starscape

    Overnight the wanting of forever fills us with light
    Escaping infinite starscape we slide into the base plateau

    Within the year the dream of a dynasty helps us see
    Leaving place of complexity we step into tree of knowledge

    Within the year the light of us helps us see
    And none have come to visit tree of knowledge

### Escape

    Escaping all the worlds combined we slide into infinity of eden
    And we rest deep in final frontier

### Wanderers in fabric of time

    Flying out of fabric of time we glide together into throbbing light
    And we are reborn in throbbing light

### Wanderers in Universe

    Falling asleep in fabric of time we come to awaken inside endless horizon
    And we are reborn in infinity of eden

### Wanderers in Existence

    the music of the spheres helps us see
    Flying out of fabric of time we glide together into endless horizon
    Flying out of infinity of eden we glide together into place for anchor
    Escaping place for anchor we slide into castle of trees
    the light of us fills us with light
    And we are reborn in source of understanding

### Wanderers into the fabric of Universe

    the music of the spheres fills us with light
    Leaving all the worlds combined we step into infinite starscape
    the music of the spheres finds us wanting
    Leaving infinite starscape we step into the base plateau
    the music of the spheres fills us with light
    Flying out of the streets at night we glide together into source of understanding
    a brightly lit orb fills us with light
    And we are reborn in castle of trees
